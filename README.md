#### I use library from https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary, as well as Keyboard library. This controller can play games on Steam and Tetri.io by pressing specific buttons to change modes.

### This is a controller mapping I use. I use Arduino Micro and 74HC165.

### Default mode is gamepad(using Joystick library), but you can switch to Keyboard mode to play tetr.io by pressing button 9 & 10 together. As for to switch back, press button 14 & 15 together.
### The python program is for the use of playing Brawl Stars on BlueStacks(Using Steam desktop setting). It can limit the mouse, so the mouse can only move in a circle.
#### Here is a video of using it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxKchEFA-Cg&ab_channel=Kelsier%E5%87%B1%E8%A5%BF%E7%88%BE
in the video, the first clip is Milk Choco, using Steam gamepad setup;
the second clip is Brawl Stars on Bluestacks, using Steam desktop setup and Python program;
the third clip is Tetr.io on the browsers, using Arduino keyboard library.
